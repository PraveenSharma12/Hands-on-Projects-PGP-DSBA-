# Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-
Hands on Projects based on Data Science and Business analytics.
I have applied different concepts of Data Science and Business analytics in each project.
## E-Commerce Revenue Management(Project 1)
[Python for Data Science](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/1-Python%20For%20Data%20Science)
#### Description
Solution of a business problem to identify which region has maximum sales volume, which type of products are sold the most, how much revenue does the E-Commerce Company and the brands that use its portal.
#### Skills and Tools
Numpy, pandas, visualization, user defined functions.
## Analyse and Explore Data and reflect the insights(Project 2)
[Statistical Method and Decision Making](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/2-Statisitcal%20Method%20and%20Decision%20Making)
#### Description
Problem 1 Austo Motor Company is a leading car manufacturer specializing in SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback models. In its recent board meeting, concerns were raised by the members on the efficiency of the marketing campaign currently being used. The board decides to rope in an analytics professional to improve the existing campaign. Problem 2 Frame an Analytics Problem on Go Digit Dataset.
#### Skills and Tools
Python, Descriptive Statistics, EDA, Exploratory Data Analysis, Framing an Analytics Problem.
## Applying Advance Statistics(Project 3)
[Advanced Statistics](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/3-Advanced%20Statistics)
#### Description
Solving the given problems on Probability, Probability Distribution, Hypothesis Testing, and ANOVA topic using the technique you have learned in the Advanced Statistics Module.
#### Skills and Tools
Probability, Probability Distribution, Hypothesis Testing, ANOVA.
## Segmentation using Clustering and PCA(Project 4)
[Data Mining](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/4-Data%20Mining)
#### Description
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques. 2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.
#### Skills and Tools
EDA, Clustering, PCA, Data Mining, Silhouette Score, Segmentation.
## Applying Predictive Modelling(Project 5)
[Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/5-Predictive%20Modeling)
#### Description
This project has two parts a) Computer-activ Project using Linear Regression which aims to predict the percentage time the computer remains in user mode. b) Women's contraceptive Project using Classification techniques to classify how many women use or not use contraceptives.
#### Skills and Tools
Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, CART, LDA
## Election Exit Poll Prediction and U.S.A Presidential Speech Analysis using Machine Learning(Project 6)
[Machine Learning]()
#### Description
This project is based on 2 case-studies: Vote Prediction and Text Analysis. The first project is to predict which party a citizen is going to vote for on the basis of their age and according to the answers given by the citizens to the questions asked in a survey conducted. The second project is based on the analysis of the inaugural U.S.A. Presidential speeches. One has to draw inferences based on the analysis done on these speeches.
#### Skills and Tools
Text Mining Analytics, Support Vector Machine - K Nearest Neighbour - Naive Bayes, Ensemble Techniques, Logistic Regression - Linear Discriminant Analysis.
