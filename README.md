#### Description
Problem 1 Austo Motor Company is a leading car manufacturer specializing in SUV, Sedan, and Hatchback models. In its recent board meeting, concerns were raised by the members on the efficiency of the marketing campaign currently being used. The board decides to rope in an analytics professional to improve the existing campaign. Problem 2 Frame an Analytics Problem on Go Digit Dataset.

## Segmentation using Clustering and PCA(Project 4)
[Data Mining](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/4-Data%20Mining)
#### Description
The data collected has many variables which makes it difficult to find useful details without using Data Science Techniques. The very first step is to perform EDA and then performing Clustering, PCA as per the requirements in the data. 1. Digital Marketing Advertisement Data Segmentation using clustering techniques. 2. Identify Optimum Principal Components that explains the most variance in the Primary Census data.
#### Skills and Tools
EDA, Clustering, PCA, Data Mining, Silhouette Score, Segmentation.
## Applying Predictive Modelling(Project 5)
[Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/PraveenSharma12/Hands-on-Projects-PGP-DSBA-/tree/main/5-Predictive%20Modeling)
#### Description
This project has two parts a) Computer-activ Project using Linear Regression which aims to predict the percentage time the computer remains in user mode. b) Women's contraceptive Project using Classification techniques to classify how many women use or not use contraceptives.
